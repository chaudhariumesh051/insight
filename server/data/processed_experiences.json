    "experience": "I recently interviewed for a UI/UX Designer position at a fast-growing tech startup. The process began with a portfolio review, where I walked the team through my design decisions, user flows, and wireframes. The second round involved a design challenge focused on improving the user onboarding experience for a mobile app. I emphasized accessibility, user empathy, and clean visual hierarchy. The final round was a cultural fit interview, where we discussed collaborative workflows with developers and product managers. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that highlighted the importance of storytelling and user-centered thinking in design interviews.\n\n",
